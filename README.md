# A Simple BitBucket Workspace Backup script

This script is created due to my lazyness in trying to back up all bitbucket repositories, especially when you have 100+ repositories.

What you have to do with this script is as follows

1. Enter Bitbucket Username (not the BitBucket email you used for the login)
2. Enter Password
3. Enter Workspace slug name
  - Log in to your BitBucket and open a workspace you want to back up
  - https://bitbucket.org/{workspace-name}/
4. Enter Destination folder (`base_folder`) you want to put all clone respositories in
5. Run the script and wait for it completion
6. Voila!

Hope it could be of use to all of you.
Enjoy
